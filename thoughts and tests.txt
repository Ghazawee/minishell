ls | cat | wc -l doesnt work for me for some reason

if i write ls | cat

then ls | cat | wc -l it works, ls | wc -l works ls | cat works, idk wtf is this



the issue is when there is a command that has >\>> the next one will get stuck because of it waiting for input, i
created empty pipe sent read end as input solved the case but for most other cases it will sigpipe or something


maybe check if output is set to something before *output != STDOUT && != -1
ls > results.txt | cat | grep result | wc -l should give zero without getting stuck, if you think you fix it try
a simple pipeline ls | cat | wc -l multiple times and make sure its not zero 

i think its working now insha'allah
some tests:
ls | cat | wc -l == works
ls >results.txt | cat | grep result | wc -l == works
ls >results.txt | ls | cat | grep result | wc -l == works ls out in results.txt, 0 on stdout, and cat/grep doesnt get stuck
<<hel ls >result.txt | cat | grep result| wc -l >results.txt == works, 0 in results, and cat/grep doesnt get stuck
ls >results.txt cat == works give error
ls >results.txt -l == works
ls >results.txt <er | ls | cat | wc -l != doesnt work second ls output is printed to results.txt, now it works, nothing in results.txt, 42(result of ls->cat) on stdout
ls >results.txt <er >out45 | ls | cat | wc -l == works, nothing in results, out45 not created, out of ls->cat on stdout
ls | pwd == works sigpipe & pwd out on stdout
pwd | <Makefile cat | wc -l == sigpipe and out of cat->wc -l on stdout, so i think it works, make sure sigpipe for builtin is fine
<<a <<b <<c | <<ma cat <<d| wc -l > out8 == works, handle all heredoc first, then output of hd d cat then wc -l out stored int out8, and ctrl + d doesnt segfault
echo "ls | pp" >>results.txt == works, "ls | pp" is added to results.txt, we just need to remove the quotes

you might ask why u using dup, well in this scenario, echo "ls | pp" >>results.txt, after running this command whatever
you input to terminal gets added to the results.txt, examples :
"ls | pp"

the shell will look stuck but if you type anyhting u wont see it and after u hit enter it gets appended to results.txt
i will continue testing later, i am burned out, i been working on it for like 8 hrs.
